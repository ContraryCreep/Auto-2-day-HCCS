Automatic 2-day HCCS
=====

What this?
----------------
This is a KoLmafia script to automatically complete the Community Service challenge path in Hardcore within two days. Or attempt to, anyway. It largely follows yojimbo's 2-day HCCS guide, located here: http://forums.kingdomofloathing.com/vb/showpost.php?p=4769933&postcount=345

How use?
----------------
Install it by running this command in KoLmafia's graphical CLI:

<pre>
svn checkout https://github.com/Malurth/Auto-2-day-HCCS/branches/Release/
</pre>

Then, given you have met the prerequisites, run it (AutoHCCS.ash) from the scripts menu right after you've ascended into HCCS, and again as the first thing you do on the next day. Also, cross your fingers.

What prerequisites?
----------------
This script is quite targeted; if you don't have the right stuff/class it will immediately abort, and it will probably fail to hit 2-day if you don't have a bunch of other stuff anyway. That being said, the most basic prerequisites are:
- Ascend as a Sauceror
- Ascend as a Muscle moon sign (in other words, have access to the friendly Degrassi Knoll)
- Have the skills Summon Smithsness, Ode To Booze and Advanced Saucecrafting available
- Have Chateau Mantegna access, Clan V.I.P. lounge access (with speakeasy/hotdogs), and the Deck of Every Card.

It also expects that you, before ascending:
- Have a ceiling fan in the chateau
- Have a painting of a dairy goat in the chateau
- Chose astral pilsners for your consumables

If that's all you have it almost certainly will fail to hit 2-day, but that's the basic stuff needed to run it.
