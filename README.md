Automatic 2-day HCCS
=====

What this?
----------------
This is a KoLmafia script to automatically complete the Community Service challenge path in Hardcore within two days. Or attempt to, anyway. It largely follows yojimbos_law's 2-day HCCS guide, located here: http://forums.kingdomofloathing.com/vb/showpost.php?p=4769933&postcount=345

I'd reccomend giving it a once-over since it details how to best prepare yourself overall, and describes how the run goes.

How use?
----------------
Install it by running this command in KoLmafia's graphical CLI:

<pre>
svn checkout https://github.com/Malurth/Auto-2-day-HCCS/branches/Release/
</pre>

Then, given you have met the prerequisites, run it (AutoHCCS.ash) from the scripts menu right after you've ascended into HCCS, and again as the first thing you do on the next day. Also, cross your fingers.

What prerequisites?
----------------
This script is quite targeted; if you don't have the right stuff/class it will immediately abort, and it will probably fail to hit 2-day if you don't have a bunch of other stuff anyway. That being said, the most basic prerequisites are:
- Ascend as a Sauceror
- Ascend with the Wallaby moon sign (well any Knoll-unlocking sign will do, but pick that one)
- Have the skills Summon Smithsness, Ode To Booze and Advanced Saucecrafting available
- Have Chateau Mantegna access, Clan V.I.P. lounge access (with speakeasy/hotdogs), and the Deck of Every Card.

It also expects that you, before ascending:
- Have your chateau prepared with a ceiling fan, foreign language tapes, a continental juice bar, and a painting of a dairy goat
- Chose astral pilsners for your consumables

If that's all you have it almost certainly will fail to hit 2-day, but that's the basic stuff needed to run it.

Anything else I should know?
----------------
Yes: run at your own risk. The script isn't too unstable anymore, and has been netting me as well as others consistent 2-dayers now, but it is still liable to bug out/malfunction or just fail to hit 2-day (for instance, by getting beaten up by the dairy goat if you don't have a few handy skills for combat). By running this script, you are accepting that risk yourself.
